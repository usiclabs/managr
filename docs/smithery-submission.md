## Description (short — for the listing card)

The most autonomous agent framework — give it a direction and it leverages 95 skills like deep research, PR reviews, market monitoring, and Vercel deploys.

## Description (long — for the listing body)

Aeon is an autonomous agent framework that runs on GitHub Actions and exposes its 95 skills as MCP tools so any Claude Desktop or Claude Code session can invoke them directly. The catalog is dominated by Dev (30), Productivity (24), and Research (17), with the remainder covering crypto/markets, social drafting, and self-managing meta-skills (heartbeat, self-improve, skill-health). Each MCP tool maps 1:1 to an Aeon skill — calling `aeon-deep-research` from Claude Desktop runs the same prompt that the scheduled cron runs. The server speaks stdio, requires no extra API keys, and reuses whichever Claude credential is already configured for the operator.

## Notes for the maintainer

- The `aeon-mcp` npm package referenced by `packages[0].identifier` in `smithery-manifest.json` is **not yet published**. Either publish it (`cd apps/mcp-server && npm publish --access public`) or remove the `packages` block before submitting to the MCP Registry. Smithery's URL-based listing works without the npm publish.
- This document is regenerated by the `smithery-manifest` skill — re-run after every `skills.json` change to keep the tool catalog accurate.
- Category breakdown: Dev (30), Productivity (24), Research (17), Crypto (16), Social (8).
