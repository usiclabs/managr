> **${var}** — Optional. Override the channel name. If empty, summarises `[REPLACE: CHANNEL_NAME]`.

Today is ${today}. Read the last 24h of activity in **[REPLACE: CHANNEL_PLATFORM]** channel **[REPLACE: CHANNEL_NAME]** and produce a community digest.

## Required secrets per platform

| Platform | Secrets | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `discord` | `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID` | Bot must be in the server with `View Channel` + `Read Message History`. |
| `telegram` | `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Bot must have been added to the chat (private chats and groups both work). |
| `slack` | `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID` | Bot needs `channels:history` (public) or `groups:history` (private) scope. |

If the secrets for `[REPLACE: CHANNEL_PLATFORM]` aren't set, log `COMMUNITY_NO_TOKEN` and exit cleanly.

## Steps

1. **Resolve channel** — `CHANNEL="${var:-[REPLACE: CHANNEL_NAME]}"`. The exact API call depends on `[REPLACE: CHANNEL_PLATFORM]`:

   - **discord** — `GET https://discord.com/api/v10/channels/$DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID/messages?limit=100`
   - **telegram** — `getUpdates` polling has limits; better to read the bot's stored offset state from `memory/topics/[REPLACE: SKILL_NAME]-tg-offset.json`.
   - **slack** — `POST https://slack.com/api/conversations.history` with channel + oldest=24h ago.

2. **Filter to the last 24h** — drop messages older than `now - 24h`. Drop bot messages (most platforms expose `is_bot` / `bot_id`). Keep replies.

3. **Cluster into threads** — Discord and Slack expose explicit thread/parent IDs; Telegram doesn't. For Telegram, cluster by reply-chain hops.

4. **Score threads** — for each thread:
   - **Reach** — unique participants × log(message count).
   - **Question pressure** — does the parent message end with `?` or contain words like "how", "why", "anyone", "stuck"? +5.
   - **Recency** — within the last 12h gets full marks.

   Pick the top **[REPLACE: TOP_N_THREADS]** threads.

5. **Detect open questions** — scan all parent-level messages. If a message ends with `?` and has zero replies after 6 hours, mark it as `OPEN_QUESTION`. List them separately so the operator can chase.

6. **Write `articles/[REPLACE: SKILL_NAME]-${today}.md`**:
   ```markdown
   # [REPLACE: CHANNEL_NAME] — ${today}

   **Volume**: N messages from M participants (vs 7d avg of K).

   ## Top [REPLACE: TOP_N_THREADS] threads
   1. [Author · timestamp] "Parent message excerpt..."
      → N replies, M reactions
      → Permalink

   ...

   ## Open questions (no reply > 6h)
   - [Author] "Question text..." → permalink

   ## Volume sparkline (last 7 days)
   ▁▂▃▅▇▆▄
   ```

7. **Notify** via `./notify` with a 3-line summary:
   ```
   *[REPLACE: CHANNEL_NAME] — ${today}*
   N messages · M participants · K open questions · top thread: <one-line>
   Full digest: <url>
   ```
   Skip the notification on quiet days (volume < 25% of 7d avg AND zero `OPEN_QUESTION`s).

8. **Log** — append to `memory/logs/${today}.md`:
   ```
   ## [REPLACE: SKILL_NAME]
   - **Channel**: [REPLACE: CHANNEL_PLATFORM]/[REPLACE: CHANNEL_NAME]
   - **Volume**: messages=N, participants=M, vs_7d_avg=Δ%
   - **Threads picked**: [REPLACE: TOP_N_THREADS] (of K candidates)
   - **Open questions**: N
   - **Status**: COMMUNITY_OK | COMMUNITY_QUIET | COMMUNITY_DEGRADED (api errors)
   ```

## Sandbox note

Telegram, Discord, and Slack all need their bot token in the `Authorization` header — `curl` with `$TOKEN` in headers fails inside the sandbox. Use the **prefetch pattern** documented in CLAUDE.md: `scripts/prefetch-[REPLACE: SKILL_NAME].sh` runs before Claude with full env access, writes the channel history to `.community-cache/${today}.json`, and Claude reads from disk.

## Constraints

- **Privacy**. Don't quote DMs or anything from a private channel verbatim into a public notification — paraphrase, attribute by display name only, never include user IDs.
- **The "open questions" section is the most useful output**. Even on a quiet day, if there's an unanswered question, surface it. That's the operator-action signal.
- **Avoid bot-on-bot loops**. If this skill notifies into the same channel it reads from, filter your own bot's messages out before scoring.
