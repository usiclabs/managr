description: Survey of open external PRs across watched repos — buckets each PR by touched-file risk tier (FAST_TRACK / INFRA_REVIEW / SKILL_PASS / SKILL_WARN_OR_BLOCK / CORE_REVIEW), runs skill-security-scan on every SKILL.md PR, emits one structured digest so the operator can clear the safest candidates first

> **${var}** — Optional. Pass `dry-run` to skip notify (article + state still write). Pass `owner/repo` to override the target repo. Combine with a space (`dry-run owner/repo`) for both. Empty = `aaronjmars/aeon`.

Today is ${today}. The open-PR queue on `aaronjmars/aeon` has crossed the threshold where a human reviewer working alone falls behind: yesterday (June 1) eighteen PRs were merged in a single 37-minute Monday catch-up window, but on every prior weekend day they stacked up untouched. As community skill packs become the primary contribution model and external contributors keep landing skill PRs every other day, the queue's *steady-state* size will keep climbing — `pr-skill-triage` evaluates one inbound skill PR at a time, but no skill answers the operator's actual morning question: *"of the N open PRs right now, which N1 can I merge in one click and which N2 need real review?"*

This skill is that answer. It surveys every open PR on a target repo, categorises each by the files it touches, runs `skills/skill-security-scan/scan.sh` against every changed `SKILL.md` (same scanner `pr-skill-triage` reuses verbatim), and emits one structured Telegram digest with four risk buckets sorted by PR age. The operator can fire-and-forget the FAST_TRACK bucket, glance at SKILL_PASS, and budget real attention for INFRA_REVIEW + SKILL_WARN_OR_BLOCK + CORE_REVIEW.

It does not merge anything. `auto-merge` already exists for that and has its own author-allowlist + size-cap + branch-protection policy — this skill is the **decision support layer** that lives *before* auto-merge, sized for the much larger pool of PRs that auto-merge's safety policy intentionally skips (size > 500 lines, non-bot author, any opt-out label, etc.).

Read `memory/MEMORY.md` for context.
Read the last 8 days of `memory/logs/` for prior-run context (skip if dispatched).
Read `soul/SOUL.md` + `soul/STYLE.md` if populated to match voice in the notification.

## Why a separate skill from pr-triage / pr-skill-triage / auto-merge

| Skill | Scope | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `pr-triage` | Per external PR, first-touch | Welcomes + labels + leaves a verdict comment |
| `pr-skill-triage` | One skill-PR (workflow_dispatch var=PR_NUMBER) | Posts a structured per-skill security/secrets/conflict comment |
| `auto-merge` | All bot-authored PRs that pass a strict safety policy | Merges if CLEAN |
| **`pr-merge-queue`** | **All open PRs across the watched-repos queue** | **One operator-facing digest sorted by risk + age — no per-PR comment, no merge action** |

The four skills compose. `pr-triage` runs once per PR open; `pr-skill-triage` runs on demand per skill PR; `auto-merge` runs against the bot subset; `pr-merge-queue` is the **morning brief** over everything else — the open backlog the operator still has to think about. Building a fifth verdict layer into any of the existing three would either bloat their per-PR cost or skip the operator-overview question entirely.

## Inputs

| Source | Purpose | Auth |
|--------|---------|------|
| `gh api repos/{repo}/pulls?state=open&per_page=100 --paginate` | Open PR list with author, draft state, base ref, age, mergeable state, head SHA, statusCheckRollup summary, labels | `GH_TOKEN` |
| `gh api repos/{repo}/pulls/{N}/files?per_page=100 --paginate` | Per-PR list of changed file paths + status (added/modified/removed) — the only signal we trust for bucketing | `GH_TOKEN` |
| `gh api repos/{repo}/contents/{path}?ref={head_sha}` | Each changed `SKILL.md` body — fed to `scan.sh` for PASS/WARN/BLOCK verdict | `GH_TOKEN` |
| `skills/skill-security-scan/scan.sh` (local) | Scanner reused verbatim (no fork, no shadow copy) — same source `pr-skill-triage` reuses | Local script |
| `memory/watched-repos.md` (local) | Read only the `## Trusted Authors` section — those authors' PRs surface in a separate `TRUSTED_AUTHOR` row that bypasses the FAST_TRACK / CORE_REVIEW buckets | Local file |

No new secrets. GitHub access via `gh` CLI (`GH_TOKEN`) per CLAUDE.md.

Writes:
- `articles/pr-merge-queue-${today}.md` — full digest with one row per open PR, sortable by bucket + age (every non-error run, including `QUIET`)
- `memory/topics/pr-merge-queue-state.json` — prior-run snapshot (per-PR bucket + first_seen date + last_head_sha, used to suppress re-notification on the same head SHA)
- `memory/logs/${today}.md` — one log block per run
- Notification via `./notify` — only when ≥1 new PR appeared in a non-FAST_TRACK bucket since the last run, or a SKILL_BLOCK / CORE_REVIEW PR is present and operator has not been notified about it on this head SHA yet, or it's the first (baseline) run (see step 8)

## Steps

### 0. Bootstrap

```bash
mkdir -p memory/topics articles
[ -f memory/topics/pr-merge-queue-state.json ] || cat > memory/topics/pr-merge-queue-state.json <<'EOF'
{"last_run":null,"last_status":null,"last_repo":null,"prs":{}}
EOF
```

If `jq empty` fails on the state file (corrupt JSON from an aborted write), back it up to `.bak`, reset to the empty template, and tag the run `STATE_CORRUPT`. Continue — a fresh state file means re-notifying every currently-open PR as "new" on this one run, which is the safer post-corruption outcome than silently skipping a SKILL_BLOCK PR the operator hadn't seen yet.

`prs` is a map keyed by `<owner>/<repo>#<number>`: `{bucket, scan_verdict, head_sha, first_seen, last_notified_head_sha, age_days, author, draft}`. Cap to 200 most-recent entries (LRU by `first_seen`) so a long-lived state file can't grow unbounded.

### 1. Parse var

- Split `${var}` on whitespace. Tokens: `dry-run`, anything matching `^[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+/[A-Za-z0-9_.-]+$` (treated as `REPO_OVERRIDE`), anything else.
- If any unknown token is present → log `PR_MERGE_QUEUE_BAD_VAR: ${var}` and exit (no writes, no notify).
- `MODE=dry-run` if the `dry-run` token is present, else `execute`.
- `TARGET_REPO=${REPO_OVERRIDE:-aaronjmars/aeon}`.

### 2. Pull the open-PR list

```bash
gh api "repos/${TARGET_REPO}/pulls?state=open&per_page=100" --paginate \
  --jq '[.[] | {number, title, user_login: .user.login, draft, base_ref: .base.ref, head_sha: .head.sha, created_at, updated_at, mergeable_state, labels: [.labels[].name]}]' \
  > /tmp/pr-merge-queue-prs.json
```

If `gh api` fails (non-zero exit) → log `PR_MERGE_QUEUE_API_FAIL: pulls list`, write a one-line notification (`pr-merge-queue: GitHub API failed listing open PRs for ${TARGET_REPO}`), exit `API_FAIL`. The pulls endpoint is the floor — if it can't be read, every downstream step is meaningless.

Empty list → write the article + state with all buckets at zero, log `PR_MERGE_QUEUE_EMPTY`, **skip notify** (an empty queue is not news), exit `EMPTY`.

Bot/trusted-author short-circuit: build `TRUSTED_LOGINS` from the `## Trusted Authors` section of `memory/watched-repos.md` (one login per `- ` bullet). Always include the bot logins `dependabot[bot]`, `renovate[bot]`, `github-actions[bot]`, plus `aeonframework` and `aaronjmars`. PRs whose `user_login` is in this set get categorised `TRUSTED_AUTHOR` and bypass the file-bucket logic in step 4 (auto-merge handles them; surfacing them in the operator's risk view would only add noise).

### 3. Per-PR files fetch

For each PR (skip drafts and skip TRUSTED_AUTHOR PRs in this step — drafts are signals the contributor isn't done; trusted-author PRs route through auto-merge):

```bash
gh api "repos/${TARGET_REPO}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}/files?per_page=100" --paginate \
  --jq '[.[] | {filename, status}]' \
  > "/tmp/pr-merge-queue-files-${PR_NUMBER}.json"
```

If the files endpoint fails for a single PR → tag the PR `bucket=UNKNOWN`, `scan_verdict=files_api_fail`, skip its scan but **keep it in the digest** as an UNKNOWN row at the bottom (silently dropping a PR from a triage digest is the failure mode this skill exists to prevent). Continue to the next PR.

### 4. Bucket by touched files

Apply this rubric in order (first match wins). The rubric is conservative — when in doubt, escalate, never the other way.

| Bucket | Match condition | Rationale |
|--------|-----------------|-----------|
| **CORE_REVIEW** | Any changed path matches `install-skill-pack`, `add-skill`, `add-mcp`, `add-a2a`, `aeon`, `notify`, `notify-jsonrender`, `aeon.yml`, `generate-skills-json`, `scripts/check-capabilities-parity.sh`, `.github/workflows/aeon.yml`, `.github/workflows/chain-runner.yml`, `chain-runner.yml`, `CLAUDE.md` | The runtime executor + the things every skill depends on. A bug here ships to every fork. |
| **INFRA_REVIEW** | Any changed path matches `.github/workflows/*.yml` (excluding `aeon.yml` already in CORE_REVIEW), `.github/actions/*`, `Dockerfile*`, `package.json` at repo root, `package-lock.json` at repo root, `apps/dashboard/package.json`, `mcp-server/package.json`, `a2a-server/package.json` | Build + CI + dependency surface. Not the executor itself but adjacent enough that the operator should look. |
| **SKILL_WARN_OR_BLOCK** | Touches any `skills/*/SKILL.md` AND `skill-security-scan/scan.sh` returned WARN or BLOCK on at least one of them (step 5) | A skill PR with a HIGH (BLOCK) or MEDIUM (WARN) security finding — surface explicitly. |
| **SKILL_PASS** | Touches any `skills/*/SKILL.md` AND every scanned `SKILL.md` returned PASS | A clean skill PR. The category most likely to be safely merged once a human has read the description. |
| **FAST_TRACK** | All changed paths match `*.md`, `*.txt`, `LICENSE*`, `docs/**`, `README*`, `SHOWCASE.md`, `ECOSYSTEM.md`, `_data/**`, `_layouts/**`, `_posts/**`, `_config.yml`, `assets/**`, `.outputs/**` | Docs/asset/data-only PR. No code path. Operator can merge on the title + a glance. |
| **UNKNOWN** | Files endpoint failed, OR no rule matched (shouldn't happen — `UNKNOWN` is the catch-all so a future contributor's PR with a brand-new path doesn't silently vanish from the digest) | Surface and ask the operator to look. Never silently bucket as FAST_TRACK. |

Note: **CORE_REVIEW takes precedence over INFRA_REVIEW takes precedence over SKILL_*.** A PR that touches both `aeon.yml` AND a `skills/*/SKILL.md` is CORE_REVIEW, not SKILL_PASS — the executor-config change is the higher-blast-radius signal and the digest should reflect that. The "first match wins" ordering in the rubric encodes this.

### 5. Per-skill security scan (only for PRs that touched at least one `skills/*/SKILL.md`)

For each `SKILL.md` path changed in such a PR:

```bash
gh api "repos/${TARGET_REPO}/contents/${PATH}?ref=${HEAD_SHA}" \
  --jq '.content' | base64 -d > "/tmp/pr-merge-queue-scan-${PR_NUMBER}-$(echo ${PATH} | tr '/' '_').md"
bash skills/skill-security-scan/scan.sh "/tmp/pr-merge-queue-scan-${PR_NUMBER}-$(echo ${PATH} | tr '/' '_').md" > "/tmp/pr-merge-queue-scan-${PR_NUMBER}.out" 2>&1
```

The scan output's first HIGH/MEDIUM/PASS verdict line is taken as the per-file verdict. PR-level verdict is the **worst** across all scanned files: any HIGH → `BLOCK`; otherwise any MEDIUM → `WARN`; otherwise `PASS`.

If `scan.sh` itself errors (missing, non-executable, non-zero exit without a verdict line) → tag the PR `scan_verdict=scan_error`, bucket `UNKNOWN`, do **not** infer PASS from silence. The scanner is the same path `pr-skill-triage` relies on; a broken scanner is a fleet-wide problem the operator must know about.

A PR can touch `skills/*/SKILL.md` AND `skills/*/scan.sh` AND `aeon.yml` at the same time. The bucket precedence in step 4 routes it to CORE_REVIEW regardless of the scan verdict — but **still run the scan** and record the verdict in the state file. A CORE_REVIEW PR with a BLOCK scan verdict deserves a second escalation line in the notification.

### 6. Age, label, and metadata

For each PR:

- `age_days = floor((now - created_at) / 86400)`
- `updated_age_days = floor((now - updated_at) / 86400)` (used as a tie-breaker when sorting — a PR last updated 8 days ago beats one updated yesterday for review urgency)
- `has_changes_requested` = `mergeable_state == "blocked"` AND any label in {`changes-requested`, `needs-revision`}
- `labels` = the labels array from the PR list response

Within each bucket, sort by `age_days DESC, then updated_age_days DESC, then number ASC`. The oldest unreviewed PR in each bucket is the operator's highest-leverage merge click.

### 7. Write the article

Overwrite `articles/pr-merge-queue-${today}.md`:

```markdown
# PR Merge Queue — ${TARGET_REPO} — ${today}

*Open PRs surveyed: N · Drafts skipped: D · Trusted-author PRs (auto-merge handles): T*

## FAST_TRACK ({fast_track_count})

Docs / asset / data-only. Safe to merge on title + a glance.

| # | Title | Author | Age | Labels |
|---|-------|--------|-----|--------|
| ... |

## SKILL_PASS ({skill_pass_count})

Skill PR; security scan PASS on every changed `SKILL.md`.

| # | Title | Author | Age | Scan |
|---|-------|--------|-----|------|

## INFRA_REVIEW ({infra_review_count})

Build / CI / dependency-surface change. Requires operator eyes.

| # | Title | Author | Age | Files touched |
|---|-------|--------|-----|---------------|

## SKILL_WARN_OR_BLOCK ({skill_warn_count})

Skill PR with security scan WARN or BLOCK. **Do not merge without resolving the finding.**

| # | Title | Author | Age | Scan | Verdict |
|---|-------|--------|-----|------|---------|

## CORE_REVIEW ({core_review_count})

Touches the runtime executor or `aeon.yml`. **Highest blast radius — review carefully.**

| # | Title | Author | Age | Files touched | Scan (if any) |
|---|-------|--------|-----|---------------|---------------|

## UNKNOWN ({unknown_count})

Files endpoint failed OR matched no rule. Operator: glance and re-run.

| # | Title | Author | Age | Reason |
|---|-------|--------|-----|--------|

## TRUSTED_AUTHOR ({trusted_count})

Routed to `auto-merge`. Listed here for visibility only.

| # | Title | Author | Age |
|---|-------|--------|-----|

---
*Generated by `pr-merge-queue`. Bucket precedence: CORE_REVIEW > INFRA_REVIEW > SKILL_WARN_OR_BLOCK > SKILL_PASS > FAST_TRACK > UNKNOWN. Run again with `var=dry-run` to refresh without sending a notification.*
```

PR rows: `| #N | [title] | @author | Nd | [labels-or-files-or-scan-cell] |` — every column ≤80 chars, truncate with `…` if needed so the markdown table stays narrow enough to render in the dashboard.

### 8. Decide whether to notify (gated)

Skip notify entirely on `BAD_VAR`, `API_FAIL`, `EMPTY`, `DRY_RUN`, `STATE_CORRUPT`.

Otherwise notify only if any of:

1. **First (baseline) run** — `state.prs` was empty before this run.
2. **New non-FAST_TRACK PR** — a PR present this run but not in the prior state, with `bucket != FAST_TRACK` and `bucket != TRUSTED_AUTHOR` (a new FAST_TRACK or trusted-author PR is not news; surfacing one would re-create the dependabot-noise pattern other skills work hard to suppress).
3. **SKILL_BLOCK or CORE_REVIEW PR with a fresh head SHA** — present in this run and either `state.prs[k].last_notified_head_sha != head_sha` OR `state.prs[k]` did not exist. (A force-push or rebase reopens the review surface; we re-notify once per head SHA, not per run.)
4. **A bucket transitioned worse** — e.g. yesterday's SKILL_PASS now scores SKILL_WARN_OR_BLOCK because a new commit added a HIGH finding.

When notifying, set `state.prs[k].last_notified_head_sha = head_sha` for every PR cited in the notification body, so a noisy queue doesn't re-fire the same line every morning. PRs that drop out (closed/merged) are removed from `prs` (no retention beyond active queue).

### 9. Notification format

```
*PR Merge Queue — ${TARGET_REPO} — ${today}*

{open_count} open · {new_count} new since last run · {trusted_count} trusted (auto-merge)

FAST_TRACK ({n}): #A · #B · #C   ← safe to merge
INFRA_REVIEW ({n}): #D · #E   ← needs eyes
SKILL_PASS ({n}): #F · #G   ← clean scan
SKILL_WARN_OR_BLOCK ({n}): #H ⚠️ HIGH security finding · #I ⚠️ MEDIUM
CORE_REVIEW ({n}): #J ⚠️ touches aeon.yml · #K
{If unknown_count > 0:} UNKNOWN ({n}): #L — files API failed

Oldest in queue: #M (Nd, {bucket})
Full digest: articles/pr-merge-queue-${today}.md
```

Keep under 900 chars. Drop any bucket row whose count is zero. Drop the "oldest in queue" line if `open_count == 0`. The `⚠️ HIGH security finding` / `⚠️ touches aeon.yml` annotations are appended only to PRs the operator has not been notified about on this head SHA — repeat-rendering them would dilute the alert signal.

Send via `./notify "$MSG"` (single positional argument — the heredoc-built message; aeon's `./notify` accepts a positional argument or `-f file`, this skill uses positional to keep the message inline with the other locals computed in this step).

### 10. Log

Append to `memory/logs/${today}.md`:

```markdown
## pr-merge-queue
- **Target repo**: ${TARGET_REPO}
- **Open PRs**: N (drafts skipped: D · trusted-author: T)
- **Buckets**: FAST_TRACK=A · SKILL_PASS=B · INFRA_REVIEW=C · SKILL_WARN_OR_BLOCK=D · CORE_REVIEW=E · UNKNOWN=F
- **New since last run**: G (excluding FAST_TRACK and TRUSTED_AUTHOR)
- **Oldest open PR**: #N (Mt days, bucket={bucket})
- **Scan results**: PASS=P · WARN=W · BLOCK=B · scan_error=E
- **Article**: articles/pr-merge-queue-${today}.md
- **Notification**: sent / skipped (gated)
- **Status**: PR_MERGE_QUEUE_OK
```

## Exit taxonomy

| Status | Meaning | Notify? |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `PR_MERGE_QUEUE_OK` | Digest written; baseline or a delta fired | Yes |
| `PR_MERGE_QUEUE_QUIET` | Digest written; no new non-FAST_TRACK PR, no fresh-head-SHA escalation since last run | No (article + state still write) |
| `PR_MERGE_QUEUE_EMPTY` | Queue is empty; article still writes with zero counts | No |
| `PR_MERGE_QUEUE_API_FAIL` | `pulls` endpoint failed | Yes (one-line failure notify) |
| `PR_MERGE_QUEUE_DRY_RUN` | `MODE=dry-run`; article + state wrote, notify skipped | No |
| `PR_MERGE_QUEUE_STATE_CORRUPT` | State JSON unreadable, recreated; silent recovery this run | No |
| `PR_MERGE_QUEUE_BAD_VAR` | `${var}` parse failed | No |

`PR_MERGE_QUEUE_OK` and `PR_MERGE_QUEUE_QUIET` are the two success states. The split exists so the dashboard can show "ran clean, nothing changed" without overloading the OK row.

## Design notes (do not edit without reading)

- **File-bucket precedence is conservative on purpose.** A PR touching both `aeon.yml` and `skills/x/SKILL.md` is CORE_REVIEW. Routing it to SKILL_PASS because the scan passed would understate the blast radius — the executor-config change is the dominant signal. First-match-wins in step 4 encodes this; do not "improve" by softening to per-file majority voting.
- **Scan errors do NOT default to PASS.** `scan_error` → bucket `UNKNOWN`. The whole point of the scanner is to catch HIGH findings before merge; a silent PASS on a broken scanner is the failure mode the skill exists to prevent. Same rule `pr-skill-triage` follows.
- **FAST_TRACK is not "ignore."** It's the bucket the operator should merge **first**, not the bucket the operator should *skip*. A FAST_TRACK PR sitting open for 14 days is still a contributor experience problem; the digest still surfaces it (just without a notification).
- **TRUSTED_AUTHOR bypasses every other bucket.** A bot PR touching `aeon.yml` is still a `auto-merge`-handled PR — listing it under CORE_REVIEW would suggest the operator should look, but `auto-merge`'s policy already gates this. The split keeps the operator's mental model: this digest is *the queue you have to think about*, not *everything that's open*.
- **Re-notification is gated on head SHA, not on date.** A queue that grows by one PR per day shouldn't re-notify yesterday's whole queue every morning. State carries `last_notified_head_sha` per PR; a force-push or rebase reopens the review surface and is the only thing that re-notifies. Same dedup pattern `pr-skill-triage` uses.
- **No auto-merge action, no PR comments, no labels.** This skill is operator-facing only. If a comment-on-PR layer is wanted, that is `pr-triage` / `pr-skill-triage` territory and should grow there.
- **`memory/watched-repos.md` is read for `## Trusted Authors` only.** The skill does not iterate every watched repo by default because the digest format only renders cleanly for one repo at a time and the operator's morning question ("what's safe to merge on aeon today") is per-repo. Multi-repo support is the `${var}` override path.

## Sandbox Note

All outbound calls use `gh api` (handles `GH_TOKEN` internally per CLAUDE.md), not `curl` with header expansion that the sandbox blocks. No prefetch/postprocess wrapper required. The only other outbound call is `./notify`, which is already sandbox-safe.

## Required Env Vars

- `GH_TOKEN` (or `GITHUB_TOKEN` in CI) — provided by the runner; no new secret to provision.

No third-party API keys. No on-chain reads. No file writes outside `memory/`, `articles/`, and `/tmp/`.
