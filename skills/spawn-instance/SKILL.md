<!-- autoresearch: variation C — robust: skill-existence validation, exit taxonomy, idempotent recovery, dynamic SETUP.md, pre/post-flight verification -->

> **${var}** — Name and purpose of the new instance. Format `name: purpose`, e.g. `crypto-tracker: monitor DeFi protocols and token movements`. If empty, notify the owner and **stop** with exit `SPAWN_INVALID_VAR`.

Today is ${today}. Create a new Aeon instance by forking this repo, configuring it for a specific purpose, validating the configuration, and registering it in the fleet.

Read `memory/MEMORY.md` at the start for context.

## Security Model

This skill creates the repo and configuration but does **NOT** propagate secrets.
The new instance is inert until the owner manually sets secrets (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, plus notification secrets).
Each instance has its own API keys for billing isolation and blast-radius containment.

## Exit Taxonomy

Every run ends with one of these status codes, written to the log and (where relevant) included in the notification:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `SPAWN_OK` | Fork created, configured, pushed, Actions enabled, registered. |
| `SPAWN_FORK_EXISTS_RECOVERED` | Fork already existed but wasn't registered → configured + registered now. |
| `SPAWN_FORK_EXISTS_REGISTERED` | Fork exists AND is already registered and not archived — refused, no change. |
| `SPAWN_INVALID_VAR` | var was empty or couldn't be parsed into `name: purpose`. |
| `SPAWN_NO_SKILLS` | After validation, the skill plan was empty — refused. |
| `SPAWN_FORK_FAILED` | `gh repo fork` and the fallback `forks` API both failed. |
| `SPAWN_PUSH_FAILED` | Fork created but push failed — fork left in place, recovery instructions emitted. |
| `SPAWN_ACTIONS_FAILED` | Configuration pushed but enabling Actions failed — recovery instructions emitted. |
| `SPAWN_API_ERROR` | Any other GitHub API failure not covered above. |

## Steps

### 1. Parse and validate the var

- If `${var}` is empty, log `SPAWN_INVALID_VAR: empty var` to `memory/logs/${today}.md`, notify: `spawn-instance: empty var — re-run with "name: purpose"`, and **stop**.
- Split on the first `:` — left is `NAME_RAW`, right is `PURPOSE` (trim whitespace). If either is empty, exit `SPAWN_INVALID_VAR`.
- Derive `NAME`: lowercase `NAME_RAW`, replace non-alphanumeric runs with `-`, strip leading/trailing `-`, truncate to 40 chars. If empty after sanitization, exit `SPAWN_INVALID_VAR`.
- Set `REPO_NAME="aeon-${NAME}"`.

### 2. Pre-flight checks

```bash
gh auth status || { echo "SPAWN_API_ERROR: gh not authenticated"; exit 1; }
OWNER=$(gh api user --jq '.login') || { echo "SPAWN_API_ERROR: cannot read user"; exit 1; }
PARENT_REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner)
# If current repo is itself a fork, use the upstream as the parent:
PARENT_UPSTREAM=$(gh api "repos/${PARENT_REPO}" --jq '.parent.full_name // .full_name')
```

Check rate limit:
```bash
REMAINING=$(gh api rate_limit --jq '.resources.core.remaining')
[ "${REMAINING:-0}" -lt 50 ] && { echo "SPAWN_API_ERROR: rate limit too low (${REMAINING})"; exit 1; }
```

### 3. Check the fleet registry

Read `memory/instances.json`. If it doesn't exist, create it with `{"instances": []}`.

```json
{
  "instances": [
    {
      "name": "crypto-tracker",
      "repo": "OWNER/aeon-crypto-tracker",
      "purpose": "monitor DeFi protocols and token movements",
      "created": "2026-04-20",
      "status": "pending_secrets",
      "skills_enabled": ["token-movers", "defi-monitor", "heartbeat"],
      "parent": "OWNER/aeon"
    }
  ]
}
```

- If an entry with `name == NAME` exists and `status != "archived"`, exit `SPAWN_FORK_EXISTS_REGISTERED`, notify, and **stop**.
- If an entry exists and is archived, remove it — the new run replaces it.

### 4. Build the skill plan from the live catalog

**Do not use a hardcoded skill list.** The catalog in earlier revisions contained broken names (`wallet-digest`, `trending-coins`, `tweet-digest`, `hn-digest` — none of which exist in `skills/`). Always enumerate live.

```bash
# Build live catalog of available skills and their tags/description.
for d in skills/*/; do
  name=$(basename "$d")
  [ -f "$d/SKILL.md" ] || continue
  # Extract frontmatter fields (description + tags)
  awk '/^---/{f++;next} f==1{print}' "$d/SKILL.md"
done
```

For each skill, parse the frontmatter `description:` and `tags:` lines. Classify the purpose into themes by keyword match (case-insensitive) and pick skills whose description or tags overlap:

| Purpose keywords | Prefer skills matching tags / keywords |
|---|---|
| `crypto`, `defi`, `token`, `chain`, `wallet` | tags `[crypto]` or description contains `token`/`defi`/`chain` |
| `research`, `paper`, `academic`, `science` | tags `[research]` or name contains `paper`/`research`/`deep-research` |
| `social`, `twitter`, `x `, `tweet`, `farcaster` | tags `[social]` or name contains `tweet`/`twitter`/`farcaster`/`reply` |
| `news`, `digest`, `feed`, `brief` | name contains `digest`/`brief`/`morning`/`rss`/`hacker-news` |
| `dev`, `code`, `github`, `repo`, `pr ` | tags `[dev]` or name contains `github`/`code`/`repo`/`pr-`/`changelog` |
| `security`, `vuln`, `audit` | tags `[security]` or name contains `security`/`vuln`/`audit` |
| `prediction`, `polymarket`, `kalshi`, `market` | name contains `polymarket`/`kalshi`/`market`/`narrative` |

Rules:
- **Cap at 8** content skills. Rank by keyword density in description against purpose; tie-break by name.
- **Always include `heartbeat`** if the file `skills/heartbeat/SKILL.md` exists (health monitoring).
- If the purpose doesn't match any theme, fall back to `[priority-brief, reflect, heartbeat]` (filtered against existence).
- **Validate every candidate** — drop any skill where `skills/${skill}/SKILL.md` doesn't exist; log each drop as `SPAWN_DROPPED_SKILL: ${skill}`.
- If the final list is empty (no content skills survive), exit `SPAWN_NO_SKILLS`, notify, and **stop**.

Save the final list as `SKILLS_ENABLED`.

### 5. Fork the parent repo

```bash
if gh api "repos/${OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}" --jq '.full_name' >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  FORK_STATE="exists"
else
  # Try the modern flag first
  if ! gh repo fork "${PARENT_UPSTREAM}" --fork-name "${REPO_NAME}" --clone=false 2>/dev/null; then
    # Fallback: POST to /repos/{owner}/{repo}/forks with a custom name
    gh api "repos/${PARENT_UPSTREAM}/forks" -X POST -f name="${REPO_NAME}" --jq '.full_name' \
      || { echo "SPAWN_FORK_FAILED"; exit 1; }
  fi
  FORK_STATE="created"
fi
```

**Wait for fork availability** (GitHub forks are async):
```bash
for i in $(seq 1 10); do
  gh api "repos/${OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}" --jq '.full_name' >/dev/null 2>&1 && break
  sleep 3
done
gh api "repos/${OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}" --jq '.full_name' >/dev/null 2>&1 \
  || { echo "SPAWN_FORK_FAILED: fork not reachable after wait"; exit 1; }
```

### 6. Configure the fork

```bash
TMPDIR=$(mktemp -d)
trap 'rm -rf "$TMPDIR"' EXIT
gh repo clone "${OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}" "$TMPDIR/repo" -- --quiet \
  || { echo "SPAWN_API_ERROR: clone failed"; exit 1; }
cd "$TMPDIR/repo"
git config user.name "aeonframework"
git config user.email "aeonframework@proton.me"
```

#### 6a. Write a customized `aeon.yml`

- Read the parent `aeon.yml` as a base (preserves comments, ordering, and the full skill list).
- Set `enabled: true` only on skills in `SKILLS_ENABLED`. All others must have `enabled: false`.
- Do not drop any skills — keep the full inventory so the child can enable more later.
- **Validate the result**: every skill name with `enabled: true` must correspond to an existing `skills/${skill}/SKILL.md` in the fork's tree. If any enabled skill is missing, abort before pushing (this is a sanity check — step 4 already validated, but the child's repo tree must match).

#### 6b. Write `SETUP.md` dynamically

Parse each enabled skill's `skills/${skill}/SKILL.md` for references to uppercase env var names (pattern: `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]{2,}_(KEY|TOKEN|URL|ID|SECRET)`). Collect the union across enabled skills, excluding built-ins (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`).

Emit a SETUP.md with three sections:

```markdown
# Aeon Instance Setup

This is a managed Aeon instance spawned from `${PARENT_UPSTREAM}`.

## Purpose
${PURPOSE}

## Enabled Skills
${comma-separated list with one-line descriptions from each SKILL.md}

## Activate This Instance

Go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions** and add these secrets:

### Required (pick one for Claude auth)
| Secret | Description |
|--------|------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key — console.anthropic.com |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | Alternative: Claude Code OAuth token |

### Recommended (notifications)
| Secret | Description |
|--------|------------|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram bot token |
| `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` | Telegram chat ID |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | Discord webhook URL |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | Slack webhook URL |

### Required by your enabled skills
${one row per detected env var, with the list of skills that reference it}

## Fleet Parent
Managed by `${PARENT_UPSTREAM}`. The parent can dispatch skills and monitor health via `fleet-control`.

## Security Note
This instance has NO access to the parent's secrets. Each instance maintains its own API keys and credentials.
```

If no env vars are detected beyond the required/recommended set, omit the "Required by your enabled skills" section header (don't leave an empty table).

#### 6c. Update `CLAUDE.md` idempotently

Find the heading line `## About This Repo` (or the first `## ` section if not present). Under it, insert exactly one line:
```
- Managed instance of ${PARENT_UPSTREAM}. Purpose: ${PURPOSE}.
```

If a line starting with `- Managed instance of` already exists, replace it rather than appending a duplicate.

#### 6d. Reset child memory

The child starts with a clean slate:

```bash
# Reset MEMORY.md to a minimal template
cat > memory/MEMORY.md <<EOF
# Long-term Memory
*Last consolidated: never*

## About This Repo
- Aeon instance of ${PARENT_UPSTREAM}. Purpose: ${PURPOSE}.

## Next Priorities
- Configure secrets per SETUP.md
- Wait for first scheduled skill to run
EOF

# Clear logs, state, topics — safe paths only, never follow symlinks
find memory/logs -mindepth 1 -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
find memory/topics -mindepth 1 -type f -delete 2>/dev/null || true
find memory/issues -mindepth 1 -type f ! -name 'INDEX.md' -delete 2>/dev/null || true
[ -f memory/issues/INDEX.md ] && echo "# Issues — none open" > memory/issues/INDEX.md
echo '{}' > memory/cron-state.json
# Do NOT clear memory/instances.json on the child — the child has none.
rm -f memory/instances.json 2>/dev/null || true
```

#### 6e. Commit and push

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: configure instance — ${PURPOSE}

Skills enabled: ${SKILLS_ENABLED_CSV}
Parent: ${PARENT_UPSTREAM}
Spawned: ${today}"
git push origin main 2>/dev/null \
  || git push origin HEAD:main 2>/dev/null \
  || { echo "SPAWN_PUSH_FAILED"; cd - >/dev/null; exit 1; }
cd - >/dev/null
```

If push fails, **do not delete the fork** — leave it for manual inspection and notify with:
```
spawn-instance: fork created but push failed for ${OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}.
Recover with: gh repo clone ${OWNER}/${REPO_NAME} && push manually, then re-register.
```

### 7. Enable GitHub Actions on the fork

Forks have Actions disabled by default. Use **typed** booleans (`-F`, not `-f`, or `enabled=true` is sent as the string "true"):

```bash
gh api "repos/${OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}/actions/permissions" -X PUT \
  -F enabled=true -f allowed_actions=all \
  || { echo "SPAWN_ACTIONS_FAILED"; exit 1; }
```

### 8. Post-flight verification

```bash
# Fork reachable
gh api "repos/${OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}" --jq '.full_name' >/dev/null \
  || { echo "SPAWN_API_ERROR: post-flight fork check failed"; exit 1; }

# Our commit is HEAD
HEAD_SHA=$(gh api "repos/${OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}/commits/main" --jq '.sha' 2>/dev/null)
[ -n "$HEAD_SHA" ] || { echo "SPAWN_API_ERROR: post-flight HEAD check failed"; exit 1; }

# Actions enabled
ACTIONS_ON=$(gh api "repos/${OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}/actions/permissions" --jq '.enabled' 2>/dev/null)
[ "$ACTIONS_ON" = "true" ] || { echo "SPAWN_ACTIONS_FAILED: post-flight"; exit 1; }
```

### 9. Register the instance

Update `memory/instances.json` in the **parent** repo. Append:
```json
{
  "name": "${NAME}",
  "repo": "${OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}",
  "purpose": "${PURPOSE}",
  "created": "${today}",
  "status": "pending_secrets",
  "skills_enabled": ${SKILLS_ENABLED_JSON},
  "parent": "${PARENT_UPSTREAM}"
}
```

If `FORK_STATE == "exists"` at step 5, the final exit status is `SPAWN_FORK_EXISTS_RECOVERED`, otherwise `SPAWN_OK`.

### 10. Log to memory

Append to `memory/logs/${today}.md`:
```
## spawn-instance
- Status: ${EXIT_CODE}
- Instance: ${OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}
- Purpose: ${PURPOSE}
- Skills: ${SKILLS_ENABLED_CSV}
- Dropped skills: ${DROPPED_CSV or "(none)"}
- Actions enabled: yes
```

### 11. Notify via `./notify`

On success (`SPAWN_OK` or `SPAWN_FORK_EXISTS_RECOVERED`):
```
*New Aeon Instance*

Repo: ${OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}
Purpose: ${PURPOSE}
Skills (${N}): ${SKILLS_ENABLED_CSV}
Status: ${EXIT_CODE} — PENDING SECRETS

Activate:
1. https://github.com/${OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}/settings/secrets/actions
2. Add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (or CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN)
3. Add TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN + TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID (or Discord/Slack)

See SETUP.md in the repo for the full secret list tailored to your enabled skills.
```

On refusal (`SPAWN_FORK_EXISTS_REGISTERED`, `SPAWN_INVALID_VAR`, `SPAWN_NO_SKILLS`):
```
spawn-instance: ${EXIT_CODE} — ${one-line reason}. No changes made.
```

On failure (`SPAWN_FORK_FAILED`, `SPAWN_PUSH_FAILED`, `SPAWN_ACTIONS_FAILED`, `SPAWN_API_ERROR`):
```
spawn-instance FAILED: ${EXIT_CODE}
Target: ${OWNER}/${REPO_NAME}
Recovery: ${one-line recovery instruction}
```

## Sandbox note

This skill runs entirely through `gh` CLI, which handles auth and does not require bash env-var expansion in curl headers (no sandbox issues). No WebFetch fallback needed. If `gh` is missing or unauthenticated, the pre-flight step fails with `SPAWN_API_ERROR`.

## Constraints

- **No secret propagation.** Never read or write `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `TELEGRAM_*`, `DISCORD_*`, `SLACK_*`, or any API key into the child repo. The whole security model depends on this.
- **No hardcoded skill list.** Always enumerate `skills/*/SKILL.md` at runtime to avoid referencing renamed or removed skills.
- **Idempotent.** Re-running with the same `${var}` must never produce duplicate registry entries, duplicate CLAUDE.md lines, or a second fork.
- **Never delete a fork.** If anything fails partway through, leave the fork in place and emit recovery guidance — the operator is the only party authorized to delete it.
- **Never push to the parent without committing `memory/instances.json` via the normal Aeon workflow.** The parent commit happens through the same path as any other skill output.

Write complete, working code. No TODOs or placeholders.
