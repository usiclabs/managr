> **${var}** — Market topic to focus on (e.g. "crypto", "elections", "AI"). If empty, checks top trending markets across all categories.

Read memory/MEMORY.md for context.
Read the last 2 days of memory/logs/ to avoid repeating data.

## Sandbox note

The sandbox may block curl. For every curl call below, if it fails or returns empty, use **WebFetch** for the same URL. All Polymarket APIs are public (no auth needed), so WebFetch works as a drop-in replacement.

## Steps

### 1. Fetch trending markets

```bash
# Top markets by 24h volume
curl -s "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets?closed=false&order=volume24hr&ascending=false&limit=15"
```

Each market object contains: `id`, `question`, `slug`, `outcomePrices` (JSON array — index 0 is YES), `volume24hr`, `volumeNum`, `liquidityNum`.

### 2. Pick 5 most interesting markets

Prioritize:
- High volume + active trading (something is happening)
- Controversial or polarizing questions (where comments will be spicy)
- Markets with high engagement and controversy
- Skip sports/esports games unless the line is wild
- If `${var}` is set, filter to markets matching that topic

### 3. Get event IDs for each market

Comments live on **events**, not markets. Each market belongs to an event. Extract the event slug from the market slug (usually the market slug minus any trailing date/variant suffix) and look it up:

```bash
# For each selected market, find its parent event
# The event slug is typically the market slug without trailing specifics
# e.g. market slug "us-x-iran-ceasefire-by-march-31" → event slug "us-x-iran-ceasefire-by"
curl -s "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?slug=$EVENT_SLUG&limit=1"
```

The response contains the event `id` needed for the comments endpoint.

If the slug guess misses, try searching by the market question:
```bash
curl -s "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/events?title=$MARKET_QUESTION_URL_ENCODED&limit=3"
```

### 4. Fetch comments for each event

```bash
# Fetch top comments sorted by reactions (most upvoted first)
curl -s "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/comments?parent_entity_type=Event&parent_entity_id=$EVENT_ID&limit=20&order=reactionCount&ascending=false"
```

**Important:** `parent_entity_type` must be `Event` (capital E). Values `market` or `series` will error.

Each comment object contains:
- `body` — the comment text
- `profile.username` — commenter name (often null/anon)
- `reactionCount` — upvotes
- `createdAt` — timestamp

Also fetch the most recent comments to catch breaking takes:
```bash
curl -s "https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/comments?parent_entity_type=Event&parent_entity_id=$EVENT_ID&limit=10&order=createdAt&ascending=false"
```

### 5. Extract the best takes

From each market's comments, pick the **2-3 most interesting**:
- Contrarian positions with reasoning
- Insider-sounding analysis or news drops
- Funny or sharp observations
- Whale behavior callouts
- Resolution debates

Skip low-effort noise (one-word comments, spam, unhinged rants with no signal).

If a market has fewer than 3 good comments from the API, supplement with a quick WebSearch:
```
"[market question]" polymarket site:x.com OR site:reddit.com
```

### 6. Notify

Send via `./notify` (under 4000 chars):
```
polymarket comments — ${today}

1. "Market question?" — YES X% ($Xm vol)
- [user/anon]: "[interesting take]"
- [user/anon]: "[interesting take]"

2. "Market question?" — YES X% ($Xm vol)
- [user/anon]: "[interesting take]"
- [user/anon]: "[interesting take]"

... (5 markets)
```

### 7. Log

Append to memory/logs/${today}.md:
```
## Polymarket Comments
- **Markets covered:** 5
- **Top market:** "[question]" — $Xm volume
- **Notable take:** "[best comment excerpt]"
- **Notification sent:** yes
```
